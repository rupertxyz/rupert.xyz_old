This is not only the end of a year but of an entire decade. I have experienced three decades so far: The 90s as a child, the 00s as a teenager and the 10s as an adult. What separates the last one from the ones before are the degrees of freedom. Suddenly I was asked to develop a vision for my life. Teenage years are boring compared to what you can achieve in your 20s. The 20s are probably the most defining years. Below are some of my learnings from this last decade. These are things I wish someone would've told me 10 years ago, though I wouldn't have listened probably ;)

**1. We are alive to be alive**

Why are we here? Why are we alive and not just... not alive? I believe it's because we are capable of many, many things. One human can change the world a lot (hopefully a lot towards a better world). We are alive to become alive. We are alive to unlock the potential that's within all of us.

**2. But... life is suffering**

Life is tough and the basic human condition is suffering. In other words: It's unavoidable to feel down and shit at least sometimes. Life is just too complicated. All we can do is put our lives together and adapt constantly to the changes that are happening to and around us. All we can do is take on responsibility for our lives.

**3. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't right (aka embrace reality aka trust & train your gut)**

The younger me didn't trust & train his gut enough. I would feel strange about a situation and rationalize my way through it only to find things falling apart some time later. I had strange feelings about girlfriends, friends and colleagues and still kept investing into the relationships. Deep down I already knew that they were built on sand and not right for me. I was lying to myself and therefore lying to people around me. Everyone of us has access to a deep, innate wisdom that guides us. We have to sharpen those instincts by testing them again and again against the real world. Often the hardest part is accepting and embracing the reality of things, finding the truth.

**4. I gotta get perspective**

I was born in Germany, one of the wealthiest countries on earth, in the most peaceful time human civilization has yet experienced. My parents are alive and well and I even got to spend a lot of time with my grandparents while one of my grandmas and one grandpa are still alive and doing well. We get to witness the early days of the internet, a technology probably among the top three of the greatest inventions of humankind. The possibilities my generation possesses are inconceivable for previous ones. I try to remember this every day to understand the privilege I was born into.

**5. We can become (almost) anything, but not everything**

Our options are limitless. There is an empowering feeling emerging from the sheer multitude of potential lives one can live. The catch is that building a career in anything takes 10 years. Becoming great in any creative pursuit takes 10 years. All good things take a very long time and often you won't see positive results until you're deep in. Patience, persistence and discipline are traits that I'm learning (very slowly).  

**6. We are all equal**

I learned this early on at university and over the years again and again. People coming from rich backgrounds or fancy schools, people in positions of power or with millions of followers on social media: Every one is going through the same shit. Life is tough

**7. The Tail End**

I moved away from home when I was 20 years old. By that time, I had used up over [90%](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) of the in-person time with my parents and siblings. I try to visit them as often as possible and make sure I have a good relationship with them.

**8. Find a life partner**

Yes, it's scary. Yes, I was afraid someone's going to crush my heart. Yes, I have been disappointed a few times. Still I had to find and commit to a life partner. I'm convinced that at least I am conditioned to having a partner by my side. A stable relationship with long-term plans makes things a lot easier.

**9. Being selfish**

When I was a teenager I often had to look after my younger brothers while my mum was working in the evenings at her second job. I developed a mindset of primarily being in service of others before caring for myself. Acting selfishly is often seen as something undesirable. It's not really. Being selfish is absolutely vital â€” up to the point where it turns into greed. The relationship to altruism goes like this: We have to make sure we're doing well so we're able to care for others.

**10. The power of the mind**

Our mind is the strongest tool we have. I underestimated its power for a long time. The intentions you set and the thoughts you think will determine your actions and therefore your life. Words like flow or momentum describe a strong convergence of your intentions, actions and results. We have to be careful with the thoughts we are thinking. Happy thoughts tend to lead to a happy life. Negative thoughts tend to lead to a negative life. Previous generations used to practice routines such as prayer and meditation as part of their religion while I grew up without such strong traditions.

**11. The human body is built for movement**

The human body is mechanical by nature and has to be trained ideally every day. We are very far removed from how humans were supposed to live while basically operating on the same hardware. Training every day is the safest way of getting rid of stress and feeling great. This may be weight lifting, yoga, running or any other high intense physical activity.

**12. We are what we eat**

Our food system is completely messed up: Big organizations producing products as cheap as possible, depleted soils growing produce that has very little nutritional value, factory farming which is horrible for animals and humans. Virtually everyone seems to have some allergy, feels low in energy and looks for diets to fix them. I believe big changes in our food system are necessary and are one of the best ways to create a healthier planet with healthier people.

**13. Attention**

Attention is very limited. Everyone tries to get a lot of it and take it where ever possible. We all have to protect our attention to only attend to things that matter (to us).

**14. I love trying new things**

Everyone who knows me knows this. I try new things all the time. I'm trying to get better at keeping the stuff that's good, which doesn't work out all the time (what did I write about discipline earlier? ;))

**15. Travel often**

Traveling changes one's outlook on the world. In this last decade I traveled to 21 countries and those trips are among the best memories I have. Travel often.

**16. Find the yeasayers**

It's incredibly hard to change oneself, but a lot harder to change someone else. Looking for people who say 'yes' often is very powerful. That works in private as well as professional life. It's much harder to convince someone about a product than to sell to people who are already sold.

**17. Opinions**

Often it's much better to not form an opinion. It saves stupid discussions, headaches and mistakes.

**18. A cozy home**

The importance of a cozy home can't be overstated. One needs a base.

**19. Music**

Very few things can move me as much as music. Music is energy, therapy, life.

**20. I don't know anything**

My list of learnings form my 30s will be longer, more extensive and probably change a lot of I think is true at this point in my life.

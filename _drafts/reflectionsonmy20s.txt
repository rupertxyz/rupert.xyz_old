## Reflections on the 2010s aka my 20s

This is not only the end of a year but of an entire decade. I have experienced three decades so far: The 90s as a child, the 00s as a teenager and the 10s as an adult. What separates the last one from the ones before are the degrees of freedom. Suddenly I was asked to develop a vision for my life. Teenage years are boring compared to what you can achieve in your 20s. The 20s are probably the most defining years for many. Below you can find some of my learnings from this last decade. These are things I wish someone would've told me 10 years ago.

# 1. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't right (aka embrace reality)
The younger Rupert didn't trust his gut enough. I would feel strange about a situation and rationalize my way through it only to find things falling apart some time later. I had strange feelings about girlfriends, friends and colleagues and still kept investing into the relationships. Deep down I already knew that they were built on sand and not right for me. I was lying to myself and therefore lying to people around me. Everyone of us has access to a deep, innate wisdom that guides us through the world. We just have to accept and embrace the reality of things. We have to find the truth.

# 2. We gotta get perspective
I was born in Germany, one of the wealthiest countries on earth, in the most peaceful time human civilization has yet experienced. My parents are alive and well and I even got to spend a lot of time with my grandparents while one of my grandmas and one grandpa are still alive and doing well. We get to witness the early days of the internet, a technology probably among the top three of the greatest inventions of humankind. The possibilities my generation possesses are inconceivable for previous generations. We can become almost anything (but not everything). I try to remember these things every day to understand the privilege I was born into.

# 3. The Tail End
I moved away from my mum's place when I was 20 years old. By that time, I had used up over [90%](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) of the in-person time with my parents and siblings. That's why I try to visit them as often as possible and make sure I have a good relationship with them.

# 4. Find a life partner
Yes, it's scary. Yes, you're afraid someone's going to crush your heart. Yes, you have been disappointed a few times. Still you gotta find a life partner. We are conditioned to having a partner by our side. A stable relationship makes things a lot easier.

# 5. Being selfish
When I was a teenager I often had to look after my younger brothers while my mum was working in the evenings at her second job. I developed a mindset of primarily being in service of others before caring for myself. Acting selfishly is often seen as something undesirable. It's not really. Being selfish is absolutely vital for us â€” exactly up to the point where it turns into greed. We have to make sure we're doing well so we're able to care for others.

# 6. The power of the mind
Our mind is the strongest tool we have. I underestimated its power for a long time. The intentions you set and the thoughts you think will determine your actions and therefore your life. Words like flow or momentum simply describe a strong convergence of your intentions and actions. We have to be careful with the thoughts we are thinking. Happy thoughts will lead to a happy life. Negative thoughts will lead to a negative life.

# 7. The human body is physical by nature
The human body has to be trained ideally every day. We are very far removed from how humans were supposed to live with basically the same hardware. Training every day is the safest way of getting rid of stress. This may be weight lifting, yoga, running or any other high intense physical activity.

# 8. We are what we eat
When I was 20, I was eating and drinking rubbish.

9. 6-week projects, being a hobbyist
		The Internet
10. Political correctness
		the echo chamber
		start thinking for yourself


If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't right (counts for ENFPs)_.
Visit your family as often as possible
You're capable of a lot and you're already enough
You can be anything but not everything

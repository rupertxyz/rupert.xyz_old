	<p>Hi all!</p>

<p>Hope you had a fantastic week :)</p>

<p>This week’s change: I’m testing Revue as a platform so that everyone joining later has access to all previous versions of the newsletter starting with this one.</p>

<p>This week’s title is “Life-Mix”, a term coined by MIT Professor Sherry Turkle critically describing how new technology makes us believe that our online life is simply layered on top of our offline life - therefore giving us the possibility to transform ourselves from (the myth of) multitasking to (the even bigger myth of) multi-lifeing. The primary goal of this weekly letter still is to spread positivity, but sometimes you cannot avoid critical thinking to eventually end up with a more positive result. That’s why I include the article below. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>AND in order to make up for it, the song and podcast episode of the week are more uplifting and a laid-back start into the weekend :)</p>

<p>Wishing you a great time with friends and family,
Rupert</p>

<p><a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580">“Maria Popova - Cartographer of Meaning in a Digital Age”</a> (51 Min)</p>

<p>Maria Popova is the editor of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a>, which is a “human-powered discovery engine for interestingness”. I have never had idols in my life, but she is definitely somebody I look up to when it comes to how to live life on your own terms. She rigorously followed her curiosity and built Brain Pickings from a newsletter among colleagues to a platform that influences millions of people every month by cultivating old and new wisdom across many disciplines. I believe you will enjoy her story.</p>

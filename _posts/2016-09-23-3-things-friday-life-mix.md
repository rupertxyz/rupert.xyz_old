Hi all!

Hope you had a fantastic week :)

This week’s change: I’m testing Revue as a platform so that everyone joining later has access to all previous versions of the newsletter starting with this one.

This week’s title is “Life-Mix”, a term coined by MIT Professor Sherry Turkle critically describing how new technology makes us believe that our online life is simply layered on top of our offline life - therefore giving us the possibility to transform ourselves from (the myth of) multitasking to (the even bigger myth of) multi-lifeing. The primary goal of this weekly letter still is to spread positivity, but sometimes you cannot avoid critical thinking to eventually end up with a more positive result. That’s why I include the article below. Let me know what you think!

AND in order to make up for it, the song and podcast episode of the week are more uplifting and a laid-back start into the weekend :)  

Wishing you a great time with friends and family,
Rupert

### Podcast episode of the week
[“Maria Popova - Cartographer of Meaning in a Digital Age”](http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580) (51 Min)

Maria Popova is the editor of [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), which is a “human-powered discovery engine for interestingness”. I have never had idols in my life, but she is definitely somebody I look up to when it comes to how to live life on your own terms. She rigorously followed her curiosity and built Brain Pickings from a newsletter among colleagues to a platform that influences millions of people every month by cultivating old and new wisdom across many disciplines. I believe you will enjoy her story.
